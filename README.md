Cheminformatics and behavioral profiling analysis via Sauron and Valar.

**‚ö† Please note:**
This is an unfinished fork of a previous repo.
It is being heavily refactored, and most tests are missing. Do not use it.

### üî® Building

The Conda build includes a dependency on [rdkit](http://rdkit.org/) by way of [chemserve](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/chemserve).
The environment file (`environment.yml`) generates a Conda environment called `sauronlab` and includes optional dependencies, including jupyterlab.
To install it, clone and run:

```bash
conda create \
  --override-channels \
  --channel conda-forge \
  --force \
  --yes \
  --file environment.yml
```

See the example notebooks under `examples`, and [See the docs üìö](https://sauronlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
for more info.

To install, first install and configure [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/).
Then run:

```bash
pip install sauronlab
sauronlab init
```

The second command will prompt you and configure sauronlab with a new database
or the database from the [OSF repository](https://osf.io/nyhpc/).
[See the docs](https://sauronlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more help.

To build and test locally (with MariaDB installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/sauronlab.git
cd sauronlab
pip install tox
tox
```

The `tox.ini` assumes that the root MariaDB password is `root`.
