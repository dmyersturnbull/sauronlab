ü¶ú Cheminformatics and behavioral profiling analysis via Sauron and Valar.

**‚ö† Note:**
This is an unfinished fork of a previous repo.
It is being heavily refactored, and most tests are missing.

Below is a simple usage and installation guide.
[See the docs üìö](https://sauronlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more help.

### üí° Usage

If using a remote connection, you can run `sauronlab tunnel` to connect to the database over an SSH tunnel.

Import with `from sauronlab.startup import *`.
or use the IPython magic `%sauronlab` to generate from a template.
See the [start-here example notebook](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/sauron-publication/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION/examples/start-here.ipynb).

### üîå Installation

You will need Python 3.9+.
Consider using Miniconda and following the setup described in
[_new data science steps_](https://dmyersturnbull.github.io/#-new-data-science-steps-with-python).

Sauronlab is best installed via pip and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org).
The simplest way is:
`pip install git+https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/sauronlab.git/main[perf,extras]`.

Equally good is [sauronlab-env.yml](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/sauronlab/blob/main/sauronlab-env.yml)
via `conda env create --file=environment.yml`. This will create a new environment called _sauronlab_.
(Note that this is different from the _sauronpub_ environment file in the sauron-publication repo.
The latter is intended only for exact replication of the analyses used for the manuscript.)

Run `sauronlab init` to finalize the installation.

- If you are using a local database, ignore _tunnel-host_ and _tunnel-port_.
- Leave `shire` as `none` unless you have access to a raw data hierarchy.

Running `init` copied some files to `~/.sauronlab`.
Take a look and edit the files if needed.

### üî® Building

To build and test locally (with MariaDB installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/sauronlab.git
cd sauronlab
pip install tox
tox
```

The `tox.ini` assumes that the root MariaDB password is `root`.

#### üîß Additional configuration

You can also overwrite any sauronlab
[_resource_ file](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/sauronlab/tree/main/sauronlab/resources)
by copying it to `~/.sauronlab/...`.
For example, you can copy
`https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/sauronlab/blob/main/sauronlab/resources/viz/stim_colors.json` to
`~/.sauronlab/viz/stim_colors.json` to change the default colors used to plot stimuli.

#### üìù Technical notes

Sauronlab is available on both [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sauronlab)
and [PyPi](http://pypi.org/project/sauronlab).
We generally recommend installing via pip/Poetry.
The reasons for this are described
[in this post](https://dmyersturnbull.github.io/#-the-python-build-landscape).
Briefly, conda will not detect dependency conflicts for packages that are only available on PyPi.
